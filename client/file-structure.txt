App Module
    - Core Module (Layout)
        -> Singletons: like NavBar
    - Share Module
        -> Shared components:
            Anything we need to use in more than 1 feature module
            In order to use the shared components, the feature module needs to import such components before using them.
    - Feature Modules
        -> App features:
            Each feature has its own module and routing
